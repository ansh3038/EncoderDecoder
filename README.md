# Encoding and Decoding Library for Base32 and Base64

This library provides a set of functions to encode and decode data using the Base32 and Base64 encoding schemes. 
Base32 and Base64 are commonly used methods to represent binary data in a human-readable ASCII string format.

## Features

- Encoding binary data into Base32 and Base64 representations.
- Decoding Base32 and Base64 representations back to binary data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- This library is written in C. You need a C compiler to build and use it.
- Make sure you have the necessary development libraries installed for building C programs.

### Compilation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.


$ git clone https://github.com/ansh3038/EncoderDecoder.git

2. Navigate to project directory
$ cd EncoderDecoder
