# Encoding and Decoding Library for Base32 and Base64

This library provides a set of functions to encode and decode data using the Base32 and Base64 encoding schemes. 
Base32 and Base64 are commonly used methods to represent binary data in a human-readable ASCII string format.
You can see about the functions available and explanations in the header file

## Features

- Encoding binary data into Base32 and Base64 representations.
- Decoding Base32 and Base64 representations back to binary data.
- Also you can convert a txt file to Base32 and Base64 and reverse and output it to another file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- This library is written in C. You need a C compiler to build and use it.
- Make sure you have the necessary development libraries installed for building C programs.

### Using

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ansh3038/EncoderDecoder.git
```

2. Navigate to project directory
```
$ cd EncoderDecoder
```

3. Use the code in your program to use the functions in the same folder or add the path to the header file too.
```
#include "enco_deco.h"
```

4. In the include folder enco_deco.a file is present to use while compliling your code.
